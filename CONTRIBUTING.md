# Contributing to React Native Starter Kit

Thank you for your interest in contributing to the React Native Starter Kit! We welcome contributions of all kinds, including code, documentation, bug reports, and feature requests. This guide will help you understand how to contribute to the project effectively.

## How to Contribute

### 1. Reporting Issues

If you find a bug or have a feature request, please submit an issue on GitHub:

1. **Search Existing Issues:** Before submitting a new issue, please check if a similar issue already exists. This helps reduce duplicates and keeps the discussion focused.

2. **Create a New Issue:** If your issue is not already reported, create a new issue using the appropriate template. Provide as much detail as possible, including steps to reproduce the issue, expected behavior, and screenshots if applicable.

### 2. Submitting a Pull Request

If you want to contribute code or documentation, follow these steps:

1. **Fork the Repository:** Start by forking the repository to your GitHub account.

2. **Clone Your Fork:** Clone the forked repository to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/react-native-starter-kit.git
   ```

3. **Create a Branch:** Create a new branch for your changes:
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   ```

4. **Make Changes:** Implement your changes in the new branch. Ensure your code follows the project's coding standards and best practices.

5. **Include Tests:** If your changes include new features or bug fixes, please add corresponding tests to ensure that future changes do not break existing functionality.

6. **Commit Your Changes:** Commit your changes with a clear and concise commit message:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Add feature: description of your feature"
   ```

7. **Push to Your Fork:** Push your changes to your forked repository:
   ```bash
   git push origin feature/your-feature-name
   ```

8. **Submit a Pull Request:** Go to the original repository and submit a pull request from your branch. Provide a detailed description of your changes, including the motivation and context for the work. Link any related issues or discussions.

### 3. Code Style and Guidelines

To maintain consistency and readability in the codebase, please adhere to the following guidelines:

- **Follow the Project's Coding Standards:** Ensure that your code aligns with the existing coding conventions and best practices used in the project.

- **Write Clear and Concise Comments:** If your code includes complex logic, provide clear comments explaining what the code does and why itâ€™s necessary.

- **Test Your Changes:** Run existing tests and add new ones as needed to ensure that your changes do not introduce any bugs.
